#Scaling Philosophy

 Scaling on three dimensions:
 
 1.  Read Replicas
 2.  Services
 3.  Sharding
 4.  Cultural or the C Axis
      - a culture of metrics â€“ you cannot fix what you cannot observe 
      - a culture of ownership via a devops model and 
      - client use case backed thinking in whatever we do.
